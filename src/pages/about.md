Hey, I'm Pavan — a battle-hardened architect vying for the bleeding edge in digital health.

## What I Do

I build privacy-preserving AI systems at [BeeKeeperAI](https://www.beekeeperai.com/), where we're solving one of healthcare's toughest problems: how to unlock the value of sensitive medical data without compromising patient privacy.

Before this, I engineered solutions in war zones, hedge funds, startups, and research labs. I've seen technology at its extremes — from life-or-death scenarios to high-frequency trading floors — and I bring that hard-won perspective to healthcare AI.

## Background

**Education:** Biomedical Engineering at UVA
**Based in:** Seattle, WA
**Previously:** Senior Engineer at UCSF's Center for Digital Health Innovation

## Philosophy

Technology should be a force multiplier for human capability, not a replacement for human judgment. I'm particularly obsessed with systems that preserve privacy while enabling breakthrough insights — because the future of AI in healthcare depends on getting both right.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting zero-trust systems or diving into confidential computing, you can find me thinking about the intersection of technology, ethics, and human flourishing.
